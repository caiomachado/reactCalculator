# Javascript Calculator - React

This is my calculator built with react.
I used styled components and react-icons for this project.
It does not have a lot of functionalities except for the operational ones.

I got the design from dribbble.com and changed a little bit.

In order to run this project.
First you must run yarn or npm install to download all the dependencies.
Then you can run yarn start to start the project.

Here are a few images of what the app looks like:
